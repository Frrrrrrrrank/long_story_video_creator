what you need to change:

image_2_video_voice.py --> login_account()  The Account of Discord that connect to Genmo

test_2_speech.py --> azure Key

test_2_image.py --> openai Key

after all configuration， just run "image_2_video_rpa.py"

chage ：
 # 定义自己的场景
    my_scenes = [
        "A chalkboard with mathematical equations, where the numbers blur and shift, illustrating the fluid nature of truth.",
        "A loom tangled with threads, half-finished tapestries hanging, symbolizing the complexity and mishaps in storytelling.",
        ...
    ]
    # 生成图片
    generate_images(my_scenes)

    # 定义自己的文本
    my_texts = [
        "In the dance of discernment, where two plus two may equal four or perhaps twenty-two,",
        "The weavers of tales, with their heavy hands, often stumble in their craft,",
        ...
    ]

One-to-one correspondence between scenes and background sound (text) commentary

Ever time you finish a video, if you wanne create a new video, just clear the audio_files and image_folder
